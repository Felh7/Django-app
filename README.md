# Social network web-site
### The main goal of developping this project is to get knowledges and experience in how the web-sites are developped.
Features i'd like to have in the end:
- User registration/authorization (data is stored in postgresql database in default django user model) +
- Authentification
- Posts adding(multimedia)(stored in NoSQL database)
- Notifications(subcribtions, likes, posts)
- Stories/shorts maybe

Stack i think i would work with:
- Python(Django+Django REST) +
- PostgreSQL +
- Nginx as proxy in front of django
- Redis for cache
- Apache Kafka
- Docker
